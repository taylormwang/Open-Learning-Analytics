## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
D1 <- read.csv("studentInfo.csv", header = TRUE)
D2 <- read.csv("studentAssessment.csv", header = TRUE)
D3 <- select(D1, id_student, age_band, studied_credits)

head(D3, 200)

```



```{r}
library(tidyr)
D4 <- spread(D3, age_band, studied_credits, 2:3)
DR <- gather(D4, id_student, 2:4)

```

Q14. What are the average scores in the "studentAssessment" dataset for the following student IDs in this order:

25261, 42818, 70827, 610573
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
D2 %>%
  filter(id_student == 25261) %>%
  summarize(mean_score = mean(score))
```


Q16. How many rows are there in the data frame if you join matching rows from the studentAssessment to the studentInfo dataset according to student ID?

```{r}
merge(D2, D1, by = "id_student", all = TRUE)
```
